Recent progress in generative models have resulted in models that can produce realistic text, images and video that can potentially revolutionize the way humans work, create content and interact with machines. The workshop on Generative AI at AIMLSystems will focus on the entire life-cycle of building and deploying such Generative AI systems, including data collection and processing, developing systems and requisite infrastructure, applications it enables, and the ethics associated with such technology covering concerns related to fairness, transparency and accountability. We invite original, unpublished work on Artificial Intelligence with a focus on generative AI and their use cases. Specifically, the topics of interest include but are not limited to: 


Systems, architecture and infrastructure for Gen AI
Foundation models and their applications
Multi-modal Gen AI 
Retrieval Augmented Generated
Gen AI based plugins and agents
Learning from human preferences 
Evaluation of foundation models
ML Ops for Gen AI
Instruction tuning and instruction following
Responsible Gen AI
Large language model performance benchmarking
